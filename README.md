bootstrap-carousel-vertical
===========================

CSS Class for vertical scrolling Bootstrap carousels
----------------------------------------------------

Be sure to import this file *after* Bootstrap's carousel css.
Add the 'vertical' class to your carousel, like so:

```html
<div class='carousel vertical' id='myCarousel'>
  <div class='carousel-inner'>
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

Note on Bootstrap 3
-------------------

The CSS located in the Master Branch was created and tested with Bootstrap 2. There is a "bootstrap3" branch which contains some small fixes needed to make it work with Bootstrap 3.  These changes were helpfully submitted by @SuggeElson, though I have not had the chance to test them personally at this time.

@SuggeElson has also provided a .LESS file in that branch.
